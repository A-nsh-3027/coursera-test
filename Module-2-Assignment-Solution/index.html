                <p>A vegan diet may seem complicated or overly restrictive. Many of my clients who are considering
                    switching over to a vegan diet are initially worried about finding suitable vegan alternatives to
                    their favorite meals.</p>

                    <h4>Vegetarian</h4>
                </div>
                <p>Apart from the ethical and environmental benefits of cutting meat from your diet, a well-planned
                    vegetarian diet may also reduce your risk of chronic disease, support weight loss and improve the
                    quality of your diet.</p>

            <p>There are reasons to eat meat and to avoid it, but few people can agree on just what meat does for our
                bodies or how it affects the planet. Some people consider meat to be a fantastic source of nutrients,
                while others argue that itâ€™s harmful to human health</p>
